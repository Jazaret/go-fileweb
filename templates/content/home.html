    <p>Web service that stores and retrieves files. Written in Go and uploaded to Amazon's ElasticBeanstalk. Implements a full browser website as well as an additional endpoint that lists the files as requested. </p>

    <h1>How to compile/run</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>git clone https://github.com/Jazaret/go-fileweb.git</li>
        <li>cd go-fileweb</li>
        <li>go get -t -v ./...</li>
        <li>go build</li>
        <li>run go-build.exe</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Website links</h1>
    <ul>
            <li><a href="/">Home</a> - This page</li>
            <li><a href="upload">Upload a file</a> - Form to upload a file. Returns the ID of the file after successful upload</li>
            <li><a href="list">List files</a> - Can download files here</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>API Endpoint Routes:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>/api/upload - POST form data with file object to add a file to the repository - Returns the ID of the file for retrieval. Response as JSON</li>
        <li>/api/download/{ID} - Endpoint that downloads the file to the client - keeps the original file name on download.</li>
        <li>/api/list - Endpoint that returns a list of all files in the system, their identifier, original filename, and the byte size of the file.. Response as JSON</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Application URL</h2>
    <a href="http://gofilewebapp-env.hte7s2zj5y.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com">http://gofilewebapp-env.hte7s2zj5y.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com</a>

    <h1>Considerations:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Code is stored on github with Travis CI for code build and tests validation. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Jazaret/go-fileweb">https://github.com/Jazaret/go-fileweb</a></li>
        <li>Files are stored in an S3 bucket with the original file name, content type, and size stored in the object's metadata. </li>
        <li>Website uses a model / view / controller structure with HTML templates</li>
        <li>The list method is poorly optimized by making a query to S3 on each file to get the original file name stored in tag/metadata. To resolve this I would add a parallel data repository/database in order to make a single call to the resource for faster performance.</li>
        <li>There is logic for a <b>token with Expiration</b> on branch <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Jazaret/go-fileweb/tree/AccessToken-With-Expiration">https://github.com/Jazaret/go-fileweb/tree/AccessToken-With-Expiration</a>. Implementation was not merged due to time. Has hardcoded expiry time of 7 days. Also would have liked to implement access using both file ID and file access token ID, but that was not part of specifications. </li>
        <li>There is no consideration as to uploading a duplicate file. We can check the file name as well as a checksum or hash stored on a seperate queriable repository to ensure that users are not uploading the same file repeatedly. </li>
        <li>Downloads and Uploads for very large files is not taken under considerations. </li>
    </ul>
